    <h1>Laboration 2</h1>
     <h3>Once upon a midnight dreary, </h3> 
     <p>while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
        “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
        <br>Only this and nothing more.”</p>
    <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
            Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
            From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
                    Nameless here for evermore.</p>
    <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
            So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
            “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
        <br>  This it is and nothing more.”</p>
    <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
        “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
            But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
            And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
        That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
        <br> Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
    <p> Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
            But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
            And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
        <br>Merely this and nothing more.</p>
    <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
            “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
              Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
        <br>’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>
    <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
        In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
            Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
            But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
        <br> Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
    <p>P Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
        “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
        Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</p>
        <br>
